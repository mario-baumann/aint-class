 *  aint provides a C++ class for arbitrary long integers which can be
 *  used the same way as the C/C++ integer types (e.g. int or long),
 *  but has no restriction on the length (if there is enough memory).
 *  Aim of this project is to include fast integer multiplications
 *  like the Toom-Cook algorithm or the Schoenhage-Strassen algorithm.
